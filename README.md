# Color-Guessing-Game
Guess the closest color from a given RGB hexcode and a color panel. 
Example : A random Red Blue Green (x, y, z) shows up along with 6 colors that are also generated randomly. One out of these 6 colors is the correct color that matches the random RGB hex-code. Choose the color you think is closest to the given hex code. 
There is an easy mode and a hard mode. You can generate random RGB hex code at any point of time in the game by clicking the reset button.
